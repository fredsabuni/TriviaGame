Database::
->

Process Flow::
    -> Pay via FastHub -> Enter / Update (Player) -> Insert (Subscription) -> SMS Sent "Subscription" -> SMS sent "1st Question" "Timer".

Logic::
    -> If Question Answered correctly send another question
    -> If Question Answered inCorrectly -> "Game Over"
    -> If Question not answered after 75seconds -> send SMS "Game Over"
    -> Ability to answer question using A / B / C - DONE & Pushed
    -> If the User has won the game / LOST session has ended they'll have to subscribe again in order to play again - TODO
    -> EndPoint For Add User & Subscription into a game its should check if User exists and update records then trigger startGame
